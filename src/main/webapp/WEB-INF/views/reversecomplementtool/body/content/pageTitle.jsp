			<h4 class="text-center">Compute the reverse-complement of a nucleotide sequence</h4>
			<p>Insert your nucleotide sequence into the text-area on the left-hand side. Press "Submit"
				to analyze the reverse-complement which will appear on the text-area on the right-hand side.
				Press "Replace" to move the sequence from the right-hand side to the left-hand side. Press
				"Save" to save the sequence in the text-area in the left-hand side to the table at the bottom of
				the page. Press "EDIT" to change the sequence in the row. When "EDIT" is pressed, the buttons
				"Submit" and "Cancel" will appear which are self-explained. Press "Delete" to remove the
				sequence. Press "Delete All" to clear the table. Click the checkboxes on the right to remove a
				select amount of sequences.</p>
			<h3>IMPORTANT</h3>
			<p>This tool is unable to save any FASTA-typed sequences (The FASTA header will be cut off)
				so any FASTA-typed sequence saved will only contain the actual sequence.</p>
			<p>The reverse-complement analyzer CAN accept FASTA-typed sequences</p>
			<p>Saving FASTA-typed sequences with its header is on the list of updates for this tool.</p>
