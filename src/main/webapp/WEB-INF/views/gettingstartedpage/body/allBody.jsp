	<h3 class="title">What is Bioinformatics?</h3>
	<p>Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that uses information technology to better
		understand biological data. Bioinformatics combine the fields of computer science, statistics,
		mathematics, and engineering into one field to be able to interpret biological data.</p>
	<h3 class="title">Why is Bioinformatics important?</h3>
	<p>Bioinformatics has become a very important part of many areas within biology. Bioinformatics
		techniques can allow extraction of results from large amounts of raw data. Bioinformatics can also
		aid in annotating and sequencing genomes and their observed mutations. Bioinformatics also help in
		the analysis of protein and gene expression, comparison of genetic data, biological pathway
		analysis, modeling nucleotide structures, and many more.</p>
	<h3 class="title">Where is bioinformatics used?</h3>
	<p>Majority of bioinformatics technology is used in labs and pharmaceutical companies.
		Bioinformatics has also become an integral part of non-profit organizations and universities.</p>
